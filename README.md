Certainly! Here's an example of how you can write a README markdown file for your movie recommendation system:

# Movie Recommendation System

This is a movie recommendation system based on content similarity using the **TfidfVectorizer** and **linear_kernel** from the scikit-learn library. The system uses movie overviews to calculate the similarity between movies and provides recommendations based on that similarity.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Download the dataset files `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

4. Open the Python script and import the necessary libraries:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
   from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel
   ```

5. Load the movie dataset and credit dataset into pandas DataFrames:

   ```python
   df_movies = pd.read_csv('tmdb_5000_movies.csv')
   df_credits = pd.read_csv('tmdb_5000_credits.csv')
   ```

6. Preprocess the data by filling any missing values in the "overview" column:

   ```python
   df_movies['overview'] = df_movies['overview'].fillna('')
   ```

7. Create a TF-IDF matrix using the movie overviews:

   ```python
   tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
   tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(df_movies['overview'])
   ```

8. Compute the cosine similarity matrix:

   ```python
   cosine_sim = linear_kernel(tfidf_matrix)
   ```

9. Build a mapping of movie titles to their corresponding indices in the DataFrame:

   ```python
   indices = pd.Series(df_movies.index, index=df_movies['original_title']).drop_duplicates()
   ```

10. Define a function to get movie recommendations based on a given movie title:

    ```python
    def get_recommendations(movie_title, input_cosine_sim=cosine_sim):
        ind = indices[movie_title]
        sim_score = enumerate(cosine_sim[ind])
        sim_score = sorted(sim_score, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        sim_score = sim_score[1:11]
        sim_index = [i[0] for i in sim_score]
        print(df_movies["original_title"].iloc[sim_index])
    ```

11. Finally, call the `get_recommendations` function with a movie title to get recommendations:

    ```python
    get_recommendations(movie_title='Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice')
    ```

## Conclusion

This movie recommendation system uses content similarity to provide recommendations based on movie overviews. By calculating the cosine similarity between movies, the system identifies similar movies and suggests a list of recommendations. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!

For more information on the functions and classes used in this system, refer to the documentation of the respective libraries:
